        crafted story telling this is the best film yet to come out of the DCEU (even though it's said not to be cannon) It's a complete satisfying 
        package that leaves some interesting story threads. I'm hoping we now get Zacks JL2 and JL3 in the future. Because one things for sure now more 
        than ever we will all be fighting for WB to Restore The Snyder Verse! Thank you Zack Snyder for showing us your amazing vision."></paragraph>

        there is in no way it can be better?\n
        Let's all settle down, it's better than the original, yes! It's a good movie. The character development is MUCH better. The CGI is mainly great. 
        Steppenwolf looks great. It's beautifully shot.\n
        It's on for far too long, there's still some glaring plot holes and there's FAR too many slow motion scenes. 
        I'll never be able to take Jesse Eisenberg seriously as Lex Luther. Too many cheesy one liners and too much laughably dramatic music.\n
        It's good but it's not in the same league as The Dark Knight. Not even close. A solid 7."></paragraph>

        <paragraph text = "Endgame is a great popcorn action movie to finish a saga of popcorn action movies. This isn't serious entertainment and shouldn't 
        be considered as such, and it reminds me of how George Lucas made Star Wars as an homage to the cheap serials like Flash Gordon. Especially as 
        comic-sourced material, this is what the MCU is. Some part of me is actually a bit pained to like it as much as I do, given that it is just 
        playing on base emotions to make money for a massive conglomerate like Disney.\n
        BUT... what a great way to end several major storylines that they invested in over the past 11 years. For people who have watched the saga, 
        I feel like this is just the cherry on the top. My only complaint is something that you can't really get away from in superhero stories: 
        the character powers are totally inconsistent from scene to scene, and movie to movie. This is a trope that there's no getting away from, 
        because if characters like Captain Marvel, Thor, Scarlet Witch, and Hulk were always as powerful as they show flashes of, then the story wouldn't 
        even be a thing. Any one of them could destroy Thanos in the blink of an eye, and have done similar feats in other stories (and even in other 
        scenes within a given story). That they sometimes reduce their power to a lower level, without an explained mechanism, is pretty laughable, 
        and makes some parts of the story a bit nonsensical. Yes, this constant Ex Machina is needed to maintain the drama and keep the plot going, 
        but it's still something that takes me out of the story.\n
        What I really love about this movie, and the saga as a whole, is how good it is at developing the actual characters and their relationships. 
        There are some similarities, but nobody is the same, and most of the arcs are believable. Thor's story, and apparent PTSD, is to me the best-done, 
        but all of the majors (and some of the minors) are almost as good. I believed them. And for a popcorn action movie saga based on a comic series, 
        I think that's a pretty high compliment."></paragraph>

        little previous knowledge about space. Not like Einstein stuff though. I would recommend you see this movie as fast as you can

        different from his previous work, check the dark knight trilogy and inception). The FX are brilliant and their are no complaints from me. 
        The acting is just great and it really asks questions on who we are and our purpose. So overall to conclude this film is just MINDBLOWING!"></paragraph>

        Kubrick with none of its beauty, simplicity and none of its art. It shows that in 1968 they were able to make a masterpiece and in 2014 they can't 
        even copy it decently. The fact that on IMDb it has an higher rating than the Kubrick masterpiece makes me lose all faith in the progress of humanity

        nailed it this time. The only thing disappointing in this movie is the way they ended it.The plot has so many holes that you can't help but notice. 
        Anne Hathaway's one dialogue ruin its ending.'Love is the one thing that transcends time and space'.Seriously? I mean if you want to take liberty 
        in Black hole's quantum data scene you could have shown anything but scientific.Anyway, overall its a fantastic movie ,after all its a Nolan movie.

        and you might realize a connection or symbolism days or weeks after. Bong Joon-ho is a master at that. The conversation that it sparks is worth the

        the father worked for his money and came home home and was always there for his children and polite to the domestics, the problem was the family 
        was just too darn naive and foolish, but not terrible people by any means, all in all just a mixed bag, Shoplifters was a much more engaging and

        metaphorical in every aspect: the water that is both a blessing or a catatrophe depending on which side of the social pyramid one stands; the smell 
        inpregnated in old people's clothes which both disgusts and arouses the rich couple; the large window in their house in comparison to the poor family 's 
        basement window. The question starts with a simple title:&quot;Parasite&quot;. Who are they? The ones in the basement, at the bottom of the pyramid? 
        The ones in the middle trying to strive, even if they cannot get rid of the smell? The ones on top of that pyramid who pretend to accept others yet 
        lack total RESPECT? Or aren't WE all parasites somehow and loose perspective so often? Wasn't a camera leading our eyes all the time? For the first 
        time in my life I had a feeling of real movement while watching a film. Sometimes I was moving left, right, up or down. Sometimes I was watching. 
        Others I was being watched. The window could be either a screen to the outside world, inside the house. I often felt watched in the movie theatre Was

        <user username = "brenes"></user>
        <paragraph text = "There are different approaches and styles of storytelling but I have always thought that bestselling novelist Stephen King has a good 
        grip over the most effective one of them. He has the image of horror master but his stories offer actually much more than quick thrills. 
        You possibly couldn't churn out up to 1100 page opuses based on just thrills, could you? King's focus is always on careful character and world building 
        because why would one want to just follow a bunch of events if one didn't care about the people in the story and what's happening to them. And he's 
        usually scarily efficient at creating characters that we want to form emotional connections to. I have read most of King's 57 novels by now, and I am 
        often hooked already on the first page, or maybe the second. The careful character and world building doesn't just happen at once, it takes time and room. 
        This is one of the main reasons why most of King's adaptations are not great ones. There is no way to compress hundreds of pages into a screen story lasting 
        about two hours. Take IT, for example. In an original novel, there's more than 1100 pages. As a movie, it runs 135 minutes, including end credits. 
        There was never gonna be a chance to see more than main events on screen, not to mention Hollywood's nasty way of often taking a famed literary work of 
        fiction and throwing out almost everything but the main plot points and character names. I read IT more than ten years ago, so I don't remember it all that 
        well, but the movie version feels... right. They have taken the best of both worlds: sweet nostalgia-tinged coming of age story as a backbone and the horrors 
        served in short intervals aside. Both aspects work well, neither feels fresh but they are effective. Coming of age story resembles 1986's Stand by Me, 
        one of the most acclaimed King adaptation of all time. Horrors are created the cheap way, that is to say, mostly by editing and sudden creepy music or 
        sound effects. Nothing essentially wrong with that, most horror movies do the same and they still have plenty of fans. I myself have quite tired of this 
        and would have preferred slow and creepy building of suspense – this would have fit more closely with King's original work too – but whatever. 
        The problem me is that there's just too many horror moments, after one hour it's starting to feel like a carnival show. One has to be a true horror 
        fan to not feel exhaustion before the end, or possibly reaching the middle of the story. Two-plus hours is a long way to watch somebody attacked over 
        and over again by the same two or three evil creatures. I mean, I like Pennywise and his crew as much as anybody but there's only so much times it feels 
        cool to see some monster suddenly jump out from somewhere and say &quot;boo&quot;. I was quite curious about how the adaptation would solve this famous 
        sex scene from the original novel. There's probably no tasteful way to offer it in mainstream movie, so they have opted to not use it all. Wise choice. 
        King should have left it out in the book, too. So. For a horror movie, IT is good enough if overly ready to use the same couple of tricks over and over 
        again. For a movie inspired by King's work, it's also good enough, giving you the simple but clear taste of what the bestselling master is possibly about. 
        For a King adaptation, it's mediocre as most of them, setting the bar too low to start with. So, you just have to go catch it and see whether you'll float too. 
        There's a possibility of part two although it's hard to tell how concrete this is. Probably depends on the box office success. The movie ends the same way as 
        the novel, which means there The young actors in part 1 are good, by the way."></paragraph>

        I was somewhat disappointed, for a number of reasons. First, like too many movies today, there is too much noise and CGI. The fact that the technology has 
        become so advanced, should not mean that it is used more than needed. There are so many jolts and excessive morphing scenes that would be totally impossible 
        of any creature, that it becomes more like a ride in an amusement park dark house, with ugly images and creatures trying to grab you, along with loud noises. 
        It's not scary, really. There is nothing psychologically disturbing. Second, while it may follow the book, having about a dozen kids make it hard to clearly 
        differentiate their identities and characteristics. There was, admittedly, some humorous moments, and many were likable, but unlike &quot;Stand By Me&quot;, 
        you don't get to care much for more than one or two of them. Third, too many scenes were very dark, which may make scares easier, but hard for the viewer 
        to see. And personally, Pennywise was too advanced mechanically to be believable, and hence really scary, at least for me. I really wanted to like this film, 
        and I didn't hate it. It just suffers from what so many genre films suffer from today: Overdoing the effects at the cost of the story and depth 
        of the characters."></paragraph>

        <paragraph text = "Movies used to be fun. Genuinely fun. Kong: Skull Island is a throwback to the era when movies were fun - like, Stars Wars fun. 
        Like Jaws fun. That kind of fun. The leads embody characters that are all understandable and genuinely likable. The plot isn't stuffed with technical geek 
        references and &quot;easter eggs&quot; that weigh down other universe-building films. From the fire- singed Kong fur to the slick skull crawler tongues, 
        the special effects are brilliantly detailed and animated. And it's genuinely refreshing to watch an action/monster film in which native peoples are 
        depicted with dignity and respect, and where black and Asian characters aren't used as props or fodder for violence (admittedly, the film could have gone 
        further with this, but I sensed some progress being made). Kong: Skull Island isn't Life is Beautiful. It isn't Casablanca. But it is genuinely, 
        thrillingly, rigorously fun. It has heart, scales, teeth and a ferocious roar. Monster movies are back. Get in line. Hail to the King."></paragraph>

        <paragraph text = "The movie disappointed me a lot. I was so excited to watch it, but I was surprised by its poor quality. Most of the film's characters 
        were bad, the monsters in the movie were not great, the action scenes were excellent, but they did not mediate the film, the film contained many unrealistic 
        scenes, the fighting of monsters in the film was excellent, I do not recommend watching the movie"></paragraph>

        I had already wasted an hour and I quit. It was going nowhere and I had no anticipation that the other 37 minutes would be any better. 
        I'd say if you go 30 minutes and don't get it, then you probably will not at all."></paragraph>
