# TFG-Movies-refactor

I created this web to people can make reviews about movies and give it a score, it is  like Imdb, filmaffinity etc. I decided to refactor my old code of my TFG.

In the fronted i have used Angular 11.2 with TailwindCss.
In the backend i have used Symfony 5 applaying a hexagonal archicteture.
